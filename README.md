# retroweb-components

RetroWeb Components is a library of WebComponents for working with JavaScript-based emulators.

A demonstration and API reference is provided at http://marciot.github.com/retroweb-components

This library was created by splitting up the functionality of the
[RetroWeb Vintage Computer Museum](http://retroweb.maclab.org) into smaller stand-alone components.
These components are meant to be simple enough to be incorporated into other websites or used with
other JavaScript emulators.
